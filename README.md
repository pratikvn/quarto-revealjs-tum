# Quarto clean inspired theme for TUM

A minimalist and elegant presentation theme for Quarto Reveal.js, inspired by
[Quarto clean](https://github.com/grantmcdermott/quarto-revealjs-clean).

An example of how the template would look like:

## Use

Depending on your use case, here are some [Quarto CLI](https://quarto.org/)
commands to get started.

If you would like to add the **tum** theme to an existing directory:

```bash
quarto install extension pratikvn/quarto-revealjs-tum
```

Alternatively, you can use a
[Quarto template](https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/starter-templates.html)
that bundles the **clean** theme plus a .qmd starter document. This is a better
option if you are starting a new project from scratch, since it will automatically
create a new directory with all of the necessary scaffolding in one go. We provide
two template options.

- Bare bones template

```bash
quarto use template pratikvn/quarto-revealjs-tum
```

- Full demo template

```bash
quarto use template pratikvn/quarto-revealjs-tum-demo
```
